A hybrid model is an AI or machine learning system that combines two or more distinct modeling approaches to leverage their individual strengths and overcome their weaknesses. This can involve combining different machine learning algorithms, integrating deep learning with traditional methods, or merging data-driven models with rule-based or physics-based systems.
